//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a partner account. If there are no predeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

=== Prepare your {partner-company-name} account

Ensure that your Boomi account has at least one available Enterprise Molecule license and that you have a valid Boomi account ID and login credentials.

NOTE: If you deploy Amazon EKS into an existing VPC, ensure that your VPC has private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances. The subnets require egress internet access using a NAT gateway or an HTTP proxy. If you want to use the Kubernetes integration with Elastic Load Balancing, you must tag each private subnet with `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb=true` and each public subnet with `kubernetes.io/role/elb=true`.
