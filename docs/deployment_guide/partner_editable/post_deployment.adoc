== Postdeployment steps

== Test the deployment
To view the Molecule in Boomi AtomSphere, log in to your https://platform.boomi.com/[Boomi account^]. On the *Manage* menu, choose *Atom Management*.

You can attach Molecules to any environment you have staged and deploy workloads to that Molecule cluster. On the Boomi dashboard, your deployed Molecule is under *Unattached Atoms*. For more information, refer to https://help.boomi.com/bundle/integration/page/t-atm-Attaching_an_Atom_to_an_Enviro.html[Attaching an Atom to or detaching an Atom from an environment^]

=== Security
This Quick Start deploys a Boomi Molecule EKS cluster into the private subnets of an AWS managed VPC. Tt cannot be reached through the internet. The cluster communicates through a NAT gateway in the public subnet for updates and patches, and through a public-facing Network Load Balancer to Boomi AtomSphere. You can only access the cluster at a command-line level through the bastion host in the public subnet.

=== Performance monitoring

Monitoring the CPU, network, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) performance of your cluster is done through CloudWatch metrics. CPU and network performance are measured in utilization, network in and out, network packets in and out, and system status checks. Amazon EBS volume performance is measured in read and write throughput, average read and write size, read and write bandwidth, read and write latency, and volume idle time. Amazon EFS reports metrics to CloudWatch and can be monitored there. Metrics include client connections, data read and data write bytes, and IO percent limits.

=== Creating an installation token

Administrators can create an installation token without having to share login credentials for an Atom/Molecule installation. To create an installation token, do the following:

. On the *Manage* menu, choose *Atom Management*.
. Choose *New, Molecule*.
. On the *Build* page, choose the *Welcome* tab.
. Under the *Create* heading, choose *Molecule*.
. Choose *Security Options*.
. In the *Token Valid for* field, select the length of time the token is valid (30 minutes to 24 hours).
. Click *Generate Token*.

=== Creating an API token

Administrators can create a long-lived API token without having to share login credentials for an Atom/Molecule installation. To create an user API token, do the following:

. On the *Settings* menu, choose *Account Information and Setup*.
. Choose the *AtomSphere API Tokens* tab.
. Choose *Add New Token*.

[start=3]
. Enter a unique name for the token.

[start=4]
. Choose *Generate Token*.
. Choose *Copy* to copy the token string to the clipboard without exiting. When you are ready to exit, click *Copy to Clipboard & Close* to copy the token string and exit the dialog.

Copy the token key value to a secure location. It is recommended that you treat tokens with the same level of security as you would a password. If you lose it, you will have to generate a new token and revoke the old one.
