// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the deployment
To view the Molecule in Boomi AtomSphere, log in to your https://platform.boomi.com/[Boomi account^]. On the *Manage* menu, choose *Atom Management*.

[#AddInfo1]

You can attach Molecules to any environment you have staged and deploy workloads to that Molecule cluster. On the Boomi dashboard, your deployed Molecule is under *Unattached Atoms*. For more information, refer to https://help.boomi.com/bundle/integration/page/t-atm-Attaching_an_Atom_to_an_Enviro.html[Attaching an Atom to or detaching an Atom from an environment^].

=== Security
This Quick Start deploys a Boomi Molecule EKS cluster into the private subnets of an AWS managed VPC. It cannot be reached through the internet. The cluster communicates through a NAT gateway in the public subnet for updates and patches, and through a public-facing Network Load Balancer to Boomi AtomSphere. You can only access the cluster at a command-line level through the bastion host in the public subnet.

=== Performance monitoring

Monitoring the CPU, network, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) performance of your cluster is done through CloudWatch metrics. CPU and network performance are measured in utilization, network in and out, network packets in and out, and system status checks. Amazon EBS volume performance is measured in read and write throughput, average read and write size, read and write bandwidth, read and write latency, and volume idle time. Amazon EFS reports metrics to CloudWatch and can be monitored there. Metrics include client connections, data read and data write bytes, and I/O percent limits.

=== Creating an installation token

Administrators can create an installation token without having to share login credentials for an Atom/Molecule installation. To create an installation token, do the following:

. On the *Manage* menu, choose *Atom Management*.
. Choose *New, Molecule*.
. On the *Build* page, choose the *Welcome* tab.
. Under the *Create* heading, choose *Molecule*.
. Choose *Security Options*.
. For *Token Valid for*, select the length of time the token is valid (30 minutes to 24 hours).
. Click *Generate Token*.

=== Creating an API token

Administrators can create a long-lived API token without having to share Boomi login credentials. To create an user API token, do the following:

. On the *Settings* menu, choose *Account Information and Setup*.
. Choose the *AtomSphere API Tokens* tab.
. Choose *Add New Token*.

[start=4]
. Enter a unique name for the token.

[#AddInfo3]

[start=5]
. Choose *Generate Token*.
. Choose *Copy* to copy the token string to the clipboard without exiting. When you are ready to exit, click *Copy to Clipboard & Close* to copy the token string and exit the dialog.

NOTE: Copy the token key value to a secure location. It is recommended that you treat tokens with the same level of security as you would a password. If you lose it, you will have to generate a new token and revoke the old one.

== Other useful information

=== Bastion host
AWS EKS quickstart deploys a bastion virtual machine for the administrator to run kubectl commands against the kubernetes cluster.

=== Pod autoscaling
AWS EKS quickstart deploys kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling with target CPU utilization 60%. If the average utilization of all the pods go beyond 60%, pods will be auto scaled.

=== Node autoscaling
AWS EKS quickstart deploys by default 3 nodes with maximum capacity =3 in the autoscaling group. To autoscale the nodes , we need to increase the maximum capacity values.

=== Upgrade Boomi Molecule Docker image

To upgrade the Boomi Molecule image, complete the following steps.

. Log in to the bastion host.
. Run the following Kubectl command.
+
`kubectl get statefulset -n eks-boomi-molecule -o yaml > statefulset.yaml`

. Edit `statefulset.yaml` and update the Boomi Molecule image.
. Run the following Kubectl command. This will invoke a rolling restart of the StatefulSet.
+
`kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml -n eks-boomi-molecule`

=== Configure SSL certificate to load balancers

Application Load Balancer:

.	Go to application load balancer
.	Open listeners tab and click on add listener
.	Select HTTPS Protocol
.	Select Forward action and map to correct target group
.	Select valid SSL certificate from ACM
.	Open security group attached to ALB and add HTTPS -> 0.0.0.0/0 inbound rule.
.	Go to Route 53 domain name and add new A record with same name as SSL certificate name
.	Edit record name and route traffic to ALB

Network Load Balancer:

.	Go to network load balancer
.	Open listeners tab and edit 443 listener
.	Select TLS Protocol
.	Select Forward action and map to correct target group
.	Select valid SSL certificate from ACM
.	Go to Route 53 domain name and add new A record with same name as SSL certificate name
.	Edit record name and route traffic to NLB
